The content of this directory, with the exception of the Makefile.am
and the present file, have been snarfed from the anonymous CVS archive
at cvs.infradead.org. It represents the snapshot dated 2005-03-04.

This directory consists of a subset of the the subdirectory util, some
files from the directory fs/jffs2, together with the include
subdirectory (complete), move into a subdirectory of this
directory. Files not needed for building mkfs.jffs2 have been deleted
(with the exception for mkfs.jffs2.1 :-).

No, there are no tarball distributions available.

To build, zlib is necessary. On my SuSE 10.0 system it was necessary
to install the package zlib-devel.
