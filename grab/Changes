1.33

- new option "-loop" to permanently record to two files
  ("*1.mpg", "*2.mpg"), resetting the PTS at each start
  of file

- fix (hope so :-) for -1ptspergop mode


1.32

- added code to handle PTS overflows at either the 32- or the
  33-bit "border". Will need some testing, though...

- if writing the output is too slow, there's now a more sensible
  error message telling the user the avbuf was overrun
  
- the new default method to give the reader thread a high priority
  is using realtime-scheduling. This may be turned off by the new
  switch "-nort"

- new experimental switch "-1ptspergop" implemented - may help
  recording of some stations

1.31

- fixed a bug that caused the -altscsi mode to be broken in 1.30

- (hopefully) fixed a system-header bug. Interesting that no player
  moaned about it so far... :-)

1.30

- support for dbox2. Running Linux, of course. 

- "new file on sync" feature: if not disabled ("-nonfos"), grab will now
  start writing to a new file on each sync.

- "checkpoints": Every 10 minutes, the status line is now emitted
  with a newline in the end, so you get a nice overview of what happened
  during the recording in the end. These lines are emitted even in
  "-quiet" mode.

- implemented retries for SCSI commands. This may help some users with
  other SCSI controllers than mine - but I cannot test that...

- documented "-nomux" switch and SIGUSR1/2 usage

- upgraded README a lot - take a look there...

- changed dropout output.

1.22

- Allow "-" as a special filename for "standard out"

- changed console and dbox status output a little - 
  there's an approximate "dropout" value available now.

- more small tweaks

1.21

- the Remuxer has undergone some more changes to make the resulting
  .mpg file compatible to some conversion programs. Big changes
  for quite a little effect... :-)
  
- some bugs fixed, sorry no lenghty comments as of yet :-)

1.1

- new mode "-altscsi" for those who get only errors with their SCSI
  controllers. This causes tagged command queuing not to be used.

- new option "-scsiadd" allows to rescan the SCSI bus for DVB2000
  (needed if the dbox was turned off when Linux booted)

- better AC3 handling. Should work now even if more than one language
  is transmitted.

- some more tweaks to make .mpg file more compatible to other software.
  No end of these workarounds in sight... :-)

- dbox display now used to show some values during recording


1.0

- initial release
