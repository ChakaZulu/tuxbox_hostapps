What is this program?
---------------------

This program records music from musicchoice channels.

Features:
---------

- Works with dbox2/Linux

- Records song by song

- fetches songinfo from musicchoice site

- stores songs in MP2 format with artits - songtitle

- writes ID3v1.1


What you need to use it
-----------------------

You need

- a dbox2 running Linux
- dbox2 must be network attached
- a Linux box for recording

How do I record?
----------------

edit the IP in mcrec.rc to match with your dbox,
set the basedir and basefilename of your choice,
connect to the internet and simply run mcrec

tempfiles are stored in folder <basedir>
finished songs are stored in folder <basedir>/finished/<channelname>


Compiling:
----------

To compile mcrec, just cd to the "src" directory and do:
./configure
./make
Please help yourself if you can.



Problems, todo:
---------------

- if everything goes right, you can record hours of music without break;-)
  the state of this program is more or less "proof of concept". I wont even 
  call it pre alpha;-)
- suggestions are welcome but please understand that my sparetime to work on
  mcrec is very limited.

my future plans include ideas like:
- shockproof songinfo fetching
- exit program if channel is switched on dbox
- automatic channelswitching based on commandline parameters
- support for cygwin
- code cleanup .... and code cleanup and maybe some more code cleanup;-)

what I don't want to do:
- a GUI


Authors:
--------

- mcrec was written by Wolfgang Breyha
- mcrec is based on grab
  - grab was written by Peter Niemayer.
  - modifications to work with "Linux for dbox2" by Felix Domke
  - AC3 tables were taken from libac3 by Aaron Holtzman

- special thanks go to Reinhard Franz for the idea
