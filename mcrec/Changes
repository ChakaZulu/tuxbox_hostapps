	some more output to sync to mcrec
	requested by leth

	fixed some segfaults if parameters in rc-file are missing
	false display of "no EPG"-Message in "-m" mode fixed

0.17 -	25.07.2003
	option "-a". archiv mode...songname and size gets stored in a database
	songs recorded once and deleted afterwards would be discarded
	(enhanced -r)
	thanks for the suggestion goes to Werner ?

	support for proxyserver added. to be configured in mcrec.rc!
	requested by Daniel Eiseler.

	change "extension=mp2" to whatever you prefer.
	requested by Sven Diehl

	mcrec uses now configure 
	compiles now at least on Linux, Cygwin and Solaris
	use
	./configure
	make
	now to compile!
	requested by Michael Alzheimer

0.16 -  16.03.2003
	option "-m <channel>". multi mode...multiply streams from encoded
	material you ask yourself? indeed, it works! as long as a streampes
	task sits on an apid it gets decoded as well as long as the same key
	is used for the sid. since mcrec is a special tool for musicchoice
	(mostly via pw) it makes sence to utilize that behavior of our
	lovely dbox2 :-B

	All you have to do is...use your usual options and use "-m" instead of
	"-c". In case of udp (-u) mcrec adds the apid to the baseport to make it
	easier. temporary files are now in format "<basefilename>_<apid>_<num>".

	But take care that you don't move to an other transponder! mcrec doesn't
	check that currently since there is no proper way to fetch tsid from
	nhttpd.

	minor bugfixes

0.15 -  26.12.2002
	option "-u [port]". ggrap-like UDP streaming support included.

	_really_ dirty hack to ignore syncs after approx. 39 mins for longer

	  be ignored option "-h" to disable this "feature";-)
	be careful! debugoutput is a bit huge on sync currently!
